title: Report from the TYPO3 Freiburg code sprint 
date: 2012-07-24 22:25
excerpt: Insprired by previous code sprints, the TYPO3 community in Freiburg, Germany decided to organize a local code sprint. From Friday, July 13th to Sunday, July 15th ten TYPO3 developers met for a code sprint. After all it was a great success for the TYPO3 project.

	<h3>Participants</h3>

	<p>The original idea was a local code sprint with participants from Freiburg. But fortunately the event attracted
		also participants from other regions.

	<h3>Topics</h3>

	<p>We worked in teams of 2-3 people on the following topics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>TYPO3 Logging</li>
		<li>sys_collection and sys_categories</li>
		<li>File Abstraction Layer (FAL)</li>
		<li>Extension- and Package-Builder</li>
		<li>PHP class refactorer / Refactoring class names in TYPO3</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Goals and Results</h3>
	<h4>Logging</h4>

	<p>The <a href="http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3v4-logging/wiki" title="Refactoring TYPO3 Logging">Logging
		project </a>overall goals are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>streamline the existing Logging with a single logging API,</li>
		<li>optimize/redesign the user interface of the Log module,</li>
		<li>create and maintain suitable documentation for the different target groups</li>
		<li>cleanup logging configuration</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The code sprint goal for Logging was to bring the new Logging API on its way into TYPO3 core by pushing it to&nbsp;the
		<a href="http://review.typo3.org/">Gerrit&nbsp;review</a> system.<br/>Ingo, Steffen Gebert and Steffen Müller
		discussed, optimized, tested,&nbsp;and reviewed this&nbsp;new API for the TYPO3 core. The decision was to
		deliver good quality, including high unit test coverage, documentation,&nbsp;and a demo extension, before the
		API is going to be pushed to&nbsp;Gerrit. So far we have ~70% unit test coverage. The documentation, the new log
		module,&nbsp;and the demo extension are still work in progress. As soon as these tasks are completed, things
		will enter gerrit. This is planned before the release of 6.0.0-beta1. Stay tuned!
	</p>

	<h4>sys_collection and sys_categories</h4>

	<p>A common use case in every advanced website is to be able to categorize records. Besides that, there is the need
		to share categories across records. So far, each extension had to bring its own category implementation which
		was not an ideal situation.
	</p>

	<p>To fill the gap, a new category record type was introduced along with an API where extension developers can
		register their own tables to be categorized. The relations get stored within &quot;mm&quot; tables as a less
		time consuming approach. In the code sprint, Fabien continued to work on this topic and it was <a
				href="http://git.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Core.git?a=commit;h=b5ba81a8fd9d33e8dfd0346f97db7e2f1997b0f4">merged
			into the core</a> on friday&nbsp;
	</p>
	<h4>File Abstraction Layer (FAL)</h4>

	<p>The goal in the FAL department was to create a possibility to extend FAL by additional fields. The concept of
		Property Bags has been implemented, which enables extensions to ship additional file properties in so called
		&quot;bags&quot; of properties. Independent of the bag definition, separate services to extract meta information
		(such as exif data) out of files are used to actually determine the values of the property bags in the case of
		automatically detected information. It is planned - though not yet implemented - to create a compatibility layer
		between the old DAM meta data extraction services and the new architecture. In general, good progress on the
		issue has been made during the code sprint, but further work is still necessary, which Andreas and Ingmar will
		follow up on during the coming weeks.
	</p>
	<h4>Extension- and Package-Builder</h4>

	<p>The&nbsp;team&nbsp;aimed to&nbsp;continue the modeler and the backend code creation of the PackageBuilder and to
		migrate the ExtensionBuilder classes.&nbsp;The PackageBuilder can now render file content based on Fluid
		Templates and create the directory structure and the resulting files. Besides that the refactoring was started
		to be independant of the current framework context. The Modeller based on <a
				href="http://jsplumb.org/">jsPlumb</a> was integrated in PackageBuilder to create domain-objects with
		properties which interact with the user-interface of the TYPO3.Ice-package. It's also possible to define
		relations between different domain-objects. The modeller can be found on <a
				href="https://github.com/drublic/TYPO3.PackageBuilder">GitHub</a>.
	</p>

	</p>
	<h4>PHP class refactorer / Refactoring class names in TYPO3</h4>

	<p>The stated aim was to continue&nbsp;the concept and implementation of a refactorer for PHP&nbsp;classes.&nbsp;The
		tool already left the proof of concept state and is able to refactor class names and references to class names.
		Further it can introduce, change and remove namespaces. It aims to be a central part of all forward- and
		backporting demands including automated code migrations. Based upon a modified PHPParser the refactorer will
		also be used extensively by the new Package- and ExtensionBuilder. The current progress is visible at <a
				href="https://github.com/tmaroschik/TYPO3.Zubrovka/">GitHub</a>.
	</p>

	<p>As a sideproject a vibrant discussion&nbsp;was started by Tom and&nbsp;is ongoing,&nbsp;if many TYPO3v6 class
		names could be cleaned up and clarified.
	</p>

	<h3>Next steps</h3>
	<h4>Logging</h4>

	<p>Once the Logging API was merged, we will start to replace the existing logging functions/calls with the new API.
		Beside that, we will write and publish extensions to provide&nbsp;additional LogWriters&nbsp;(e.g. to email,
		Graylog2)&nbsp;and&nbsp;LogProcessors&nbsp;(additional system information)&nbsp;and finish the Backend module.
	</p>
	<h4>sys_collection and sys_categories</h4>

	<p>We have to create some buzz to demonstate the categorization feature and hopefully will see a growing number of
		extensions adapting it. A category tree could be build based on the page tree.
	</p>
	<h4>Extension Builder</h4>

	<p>The next steps for the Modeller are refining the behavior of relations and domain-objects and their interaction
		with other parts of the PackageBuilder.
	</p>
	<h4>Refactoring class names in TYPO3</h4>

	<p>After the PHPParser has reached a stable state, it will replace the regex based class parser in the Package- and
		ExtensionBuilder. We will take the chance of the 6.0 release and try to clean up TYPO3 class names using the
		PHPParser. A discussion about that is going on in the TYPO3 core-mailinglist.
	</p>

	<h3>Community spirit</h3>

	<p>The event was a great success. We had a lot of fun spending our time on the TYPO3 project. Working in teams and
		meeting developers was very motivating and increased productivity. We hope to see more code sprints in the
		future.
	</p>

	<h3>Thanks to our sponsors</h3>

	<p>We are very happy that all expenses were covered by our sponsors. This once again proved that the TYPO3 project
		is run by real community players.
