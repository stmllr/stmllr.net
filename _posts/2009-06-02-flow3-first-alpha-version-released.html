	<p><a href="http://flow3.typo3.org/news/0/1/" title="Official news article about the FLOW3 aplha 1 release"
			   class="external-link">FLOW3</a> is meant as the next generation PHP application framework, which will be
	the basis for the forthcoming TYPO3 version 5. It has now been developed for 2.5 years and finally reached an alpha
	state. You can find a <a href="http://flow3.typo3.org/about/features/" title="Main features of FLOW3"
							 class="external-link">feature list at the FLOW3 website</a>.
</p>

	<p> I already got in contact with FLOW3 at <a href="http://t3dd09.typo3.org"
												  title="T3DD09 - the official TYPO3 Developer Days 2009"
												  class="external-link">T3DD09</a>, listening to <a
			href="http://t3dd09.typo3.org/recordings.html" title="Some recordings of talks at T3DD09"
			class="external-link">several talks</a> about its architecture and components and playing a bit with the
		code. This milestone release comes just in time with <a
				href="/blog/2009-05-15-extbase-presentation-at-t3dd09.html">Extbase</a>, the forthcoming <a
				href="http://forge.typo3.org/wiki/typo3v4-mvc/MVC_Concept"
				title="Extbase project website at TYPO3 forge" class="external-link">backport of the MVC pattern</a> of
		FLOW3 for TYPO3 version 4.x.
	</p>

	<p>I am very curious about the progress of these projects, since I am already infected by the new design patterns
		and programming paradigms. I also see more and more people testing and writing FLOW3 and Extbase stuff which
		makes me confident about its success. Still there is a lot of criticism and scepticism about FLOW3, especially
		the question of performance. Anyway this is a first alpha release and there's still enough time and code left to
		solve these problems.
	</p>

	<p>Keep on with your good work!
