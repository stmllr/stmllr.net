title: Nested domains in a single TYPO3 pagetree
date: 2008-07-31 20:03
excerpt: A common scenario in maintaining websites is to have a handful of websites, each with little content and a single person who is in charge of the content. Why not throw everything into a single TYPO3 installation?

<section>
	<p>Maintaining multiple domains inside one TYPO3 instance is possible. But it can be tricky, especially when using
		RealURL and domains are nested. You need to carry together the neccessary configuration options. Until today
		this is not as easy as you might think. The following prerequisites are essential, additional to your usual
		setup:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use TYPO3 Version 4.2 (because HMENU does not use typolink in &gt;=4.1)</li>
		<li>use RealURL Version &gt;=1.4.0</li>
		<li>setup TypoScript of all rootpage templates (the first three items of course can be merged into a global
			template):
		</li>
		<br/>
		<pre>config {<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;simulateStaticDocuments = 0<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;tx_realurl_enable = 1<br/>   # render internal links between domains<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;typolinkCheckRootline = 1 <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;baseURL = <a
				href="http://mydomain.com/">mydomain.com</a><br/>}</pre>
		<li>set domain record in every rootpage</li>
		<li>set the rootlevel flag in the rootpage templates</li>
		<li>set the &quot;Is root of website&quot; flag in the rootpage properties. This is essential for nested
			domains.
		</li>
		<li>set the rootpage_id for every domain in the RealURL configuration part in typo3conf/localconf.php:</li>
		<br/>
		<pre> $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['EXTCONF']['realurl'] = array(<br/>   'www.foo.com' =&gt; array(<br/>     'pagePath' =&gt; array(<br/>       'rootpage_id' = 1234<br/>   ...<br/>   ),<br/>   'www.bar.com' =&gt; array (<br/>     'pagePath' =&gt; array(<br/>       'rootpage_id' = 5678<br/>   ...<br/>   ),<br/> </pre>
	</ul>
	<p>However, you could still run into problems. Keep your eyes open for recent patches in the TYPO3-core list and
		related bugs.

				Hi Steffen,<br/>
				<br/>
				thanks for the tip. Unfortunally there seems missing a recursive check, as this works only with pages
				having this flag. If only parent page has "is root" it doesn't work :(

				Where can I find this check flag?<br/>

				Thank you!

				Steffen means the "Is root of website" flag in the page properties.
