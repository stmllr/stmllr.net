	<p>I use <a href="http://www.foxmarks.com/" title="Foxmarks homepage" class="external-link">Foxmarks</a> to
		synchronize my bookmarks. You simply need to install a <a
				href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/2410" title="The Foxmarks Add-on"
				class="external-link">Firefox Add-on</a> (Firefox 2.0 only!) and register yourself at Foxmarks.com to
		use their webservice. If you dislike the idea of storing your treasury on someone else's server, you can also <a

				title="FAQ of the Foxmarks wiki" class="external-link">use your own webdav environment</a> for
		storage.<br/>
	</p>

	<p>The bookmarks are encoded as JSON and stored as a single file. Fortunately, <a

			title="Blog entry of Stefan Macke" class="external-link">Stefan Macke</a> (german!) now provides a PHP
		script to convert JSON to HTML to display your bookmarks on a website. Thank you, Stefan!

				The latest Version (2.0.46.9) finally seems to be compatible with FF3!

				Since Foxmarks has fundamentally changed their policy and technology in version 3, I strongly recommend
				to use Mozilla Weave instead:<br/>
				<a href="http://mozillalabs.com/weave/">http://mozillalabs.com/weave/</a><br/>
				<br/>
				Weave not only allows to synchronize bookmarks, but also all user setting. You can have your own server:<br/>
