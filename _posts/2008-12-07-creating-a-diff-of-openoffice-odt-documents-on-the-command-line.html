		All you need to have the following two new tools:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="http://stosberg.net/odt2txt/" title="Project homepage (in german only)" class="external-link">odt2txt</a>
			for extracting the content of an OpenOffice.org document. (A Debian package is available)
		</li>
		<li><a href="http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~moy/opendocument/" title="Creating diffs with opendocument files"
			   class="external-link">oodiff</a> for comparing the content.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The real easter egg is that you can compare your local copy with the latest subversion revision. Well, oodiff
		does not really connect to subversion, but uses a local copy of the .svn directory. Git and Mercurial are also
		supported.
