title: Best kept TYPO3 secret - WAF
date: 2008-10-10 23:22
excerpt: The security team long time ago promised to release a ruleset for a Web Application Firewall (WAF) based on Apache's mod_security. Some are still waiting for an official announcement after the conference talk at T3CON07. And some have heard about it on todays talk at T3CON08.

	<p>For those who can't wait any longer for official announcements: it's already there since, well, since the
		beginning of this year I guess. The <a
				href="http://lists.netfielders.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-project-waf"
				title="The archive of the TYPO3 Mailinglist about WAF" class="external-link">waf-newsgroup</a> lacks a
		bit in activity (4 postings in one year), but one postings already revealed the secret on January 2008:
	</p>

	<p><b>The ruleset hides at <a href="http://typo3.org/waf.txt" title="mod_security WAF ruleset for TYPO3"
								  class="external-link">http://typo3.org/waf.txt</a></b>
	</p>

	<p>I didn't test it but had a quick look at the file. It's a quite short configuration and I could not spot any
		TYPO3 specific rules. One lines points to an external file called modsecurity_crs_9999_typo3.conf but I couldn't
		find that file. Well, waf.txt also reveals that the current version was written on September, 2007. So maybe a
		newer one is already released, but kept secret somewhere else ;-)
