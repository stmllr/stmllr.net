	<p>
		The TYPO3 community from Freiburg organizes another Code Sprint on November 02 - November 04.
	</p>

	<p>The ExtensionBuilder/PackageBuilder:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>supports agile development,</li>
		<li>helps developers focus on DDD (Domain Driven Design),</li>
		<li>enables developers to model their domains for both TYPO3 CMS and TYPO3 flow. Using one and the same tool for
			developing TYPO3 CMS and TYPO3 Flow will be essential for being able to exchange work between the projects.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The actual ExtensionBuilder for TYPO3 CMS is a great sucess, but is reaching its limits for usability, frontend
		code maintenance and portability. A new approach is on the way which includes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>an improved extendable modeler interface</li>
		<li>usability</li>
		<li>namespaces and composer adaptions</li>
		<li>code generation of TYPO3 CMS extensions and Flow/Neos packages from a single interface</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You are invited to participate in the Code Sprint if you have experiences in one of the following areas:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Extbase,</li>
		<li>Flow/Neos,</li>
		<li>PHP composer (Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the dependent
			libraries your project needs and it will install them in your project for you.),
		</li>
		<li>jQuery,</li>
		<li>ember.js,</li>
		<li>unit/function/acceptance tests</li>
	</ul>
