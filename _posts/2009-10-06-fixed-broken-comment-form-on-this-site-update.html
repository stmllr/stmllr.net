title: Fixed broken comment form on this site (update)
date: 2009-10-06 11:22
excerpt: The comment form of this blog was broken the last two days. The reason was that I disabled the no_cache parameter in the install tool. It seems the ve_guestbook extension somehow relies on this parameter. The comments are now working properly again. Sorry for the inconvenience.

	<h3>Update</h3>

	<p>Meanwhile I found out that ve_guestbook disables complete caching of pages with the guestbook form. I don't like
		that and it's not necessary. The plugin could be rendered as USER_INT instead of disabling page cache. I sent a
		<a href="http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=12131" title="Bug report about ve_guestbook using no_cache"
		   class="external-link">bug report #12131</a> and appended a <a
				href="http://bugs.typo3.org/file_download.php?file_id=8572&amp;type=bug"
				title="Download the patch which hopefully fixes the issue" class="external-link">patch</a> which fixes
		this issue: <a href="http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=12131" title="Bug report" class="external-link">http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=12131</a>
