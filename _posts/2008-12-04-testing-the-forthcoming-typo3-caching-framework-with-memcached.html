title: Testing the forthcoming TYPO3 caching framework with memcached
date: 2008-12-04 00:42
excerpt: I just did some quick tests with the forthcoming caching framework of TYPO3. The results were surprising, although not the way I did expect.

<section>
	<p> The caching framework was backported from FLOW3 for the forthcoming 4.3 release. The first commited version had
		some issues with memcached, so I decided to wait for a full working version.</p>

	<p><img alt="Engine" title="Diesel power" src="/files/images/engine.jpg" width="250" height="175"/></p>

	<p>Dmitry fixed the issues some days ago and <a
			href="http://typo3bloke.net/post-details/how_to_enable_memcached_cache_in_typo3_43/"
			title="Blog posting by Dmitry Dulepov" class="external-link">posted a small howto</a> in his blog on using
		memcache as a caching backend for TYPO3 pagecache.
	</p>

	<p>Today, I tried to see how it works. The setup for TYPO3 was really easy and it worked without any problems.
		Installing memcached and php module on Debian was a nobrainer, so no time was wasted.
	</p>

	<p>But my first tests were a bit disappointing. First, I used memcached on a lightweight virtualbox and the gain of
		using memcached instead of DB tables for cache_* &quot;tables&quot; was zeeeeero:
	</p>
	<pre> ab -c 100 -n 5000 http ://virtual.box.test/ </pre>
	<p>The tests revealed ridiculous <b>8 req/s</b> (mean) both using DB tables and memcached for caching. I realized,
		that the CPU could have been the bottleneck, because it immediately went to 100%. My conclusion was that the
		virtual box was too lame to get significant results. So I decided to switch to a real machine.
	</p>

	<p>I decided to use an AMD BE-2350 machine for further tests.
	</p>
	<pre> ab -c 100 -n 5000 http ://physical.box.test/ </pre>
	<p>The same basic tests with ApacheBench resulted in overall better performance and a slightly difference between
		memcached <b>(170 req/s</b>) and classic caching (<b>135 req/s</b>). But still not the boost I had expected.
		Once again looking at the CPU load, it was 100%. Most load was caused by fcgid and mysql, but I couldn't do any
		further tests because midnight cronjobs started and I did'nt want to stop them.
	</p>

	<p>The next step will be to replay the tests on a machine using mod_php instead of fcgid. But I'm also looking
		forward for some more reports from the community to crosscheck my own results.
	</p>

	<p>Anyway, the backport of the caching framework is very good work. It spends hope to have a smooth migration path
		to FLOW3 and TYPO3 v.5. So a big <b>thank you</b> goes out to core devs for their efforts.

				Ingo, once I find some time, I'll test it again and provide more details about setup.

				The extension enetcacheanalytics (forge) comes with a backend module to compare the different caching
				framework backends. I need to get it up-to-date again, but it should still be able to create some
				graphics about the different backends in direct comparison under different loads.

				Thanks for your feedback, Christian.<br/>
				<br/>
				This article was written on very basic assumtions. The underlying usecase is just a simple setup,
				compared to the many different possibilities of the caching framework.<br/>
				I also agree that ab is not the best tool for measuring performance. It was just a quick shot to get my
				hands on the caching framework for the first time.<br/>
				So I am looking forward to see how enetcacheanalytics does the job. <br/>
