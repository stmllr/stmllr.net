title: TYPO3 breaks on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Hardy Heron (and how to fix it)
date: 2008-05-09 19:24
excerpt: After a dist-upgrade from Gutsy to Hardy on our webserver, TYPO3 was suddenly broken. The reason is a bug in PHP 5.2.4. There is a workaround for TYPO3, but unfortunately the patch is still pending in the core list.
