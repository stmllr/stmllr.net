title: Combining Fluid ViewHelpers and TypoScript in TYPO3 - 5 basic examples
date: 2010-07-29 17:42
excerpt: Here comes another blog article about TYPO3 after a long time of absence. This time I introduce the Fluid cObject ViewHelper, which brings together the power of TypoScript and Fluid. I will demonstrate the usage of this ViewHelper in five basic examples.

<section>
	<h3> 1. Simple usage of the cObject ViewHelper: A breadcrumb menu</h3>

	<p>Any website with hierarchical pages should have a breadcrumb menu.<br/>The TypoScript in this example creates a
		breadcrumb menu by using a HMENU of type rootline. The Fluid ViewHelper gets the result from this cObject and
		displays it in the template.
	</p>
	<h4>Fluid:</h4>
	<pre>&lt;f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath=&quot;lib.breadcrumb&quot; /&gt;</pre>
	<h4>TypoScript:</h4>
	<pre>lib.breadcrumb = HMENU<br/>lib.breadcrumb {<br/>&nbsp; special = rootline<br/>&nbsp; special.range = 0|-1<br/>&nbsp; 1 = TMENU<br/>&nbsp; 1 {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO.linkWrap = | &gt;&gt;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CUR = 1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CUR.doNotLinkIt = 1<br/>&nbsp; }<br/>}</pre>
	<h4>Result:</h4>
	<pre>Home &gt;&gt; Learning TYPO3 &gt;&gt; Fluid examples </pre>
	<h3>2. Passing static values from Fluid to TypoScript: Let TypoScript calculate some numbers</h3>

	<p>Let's assume that you have some math homework and need to calculate some numbers.<br/>All we need to do is to
		tell Fluid our arithmetic problem in the &quot;data&quot; parameter. This value is passed to TypoScript as the
		current value, where we do the calculation. The result of this calculation is returned to the template.
	</p>
	<h4>Fluid:</h4>
	<pre>20 + 22 = &lt;f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath=&quot;lib.math&quot; data=&quot;20+22&quot; /&gt;</pre>
	<h4>TypoScript:</h4>
	<pre>lib.math = TEXT<br/>lib.math {<br/>&nbsp; current = 1<br/>&nbsp; prioriCalc = 1<br/>}</pre>
	<h4>Result:</h4>
	<pre>20 + 22 = 42</pre>
	<p>This is a very simple demonstration. To make this more comfortable, you would probably use the form ViewHelper to
		have a form field to enter the calculation task.
	</p>

	<h3>3. Passing dynamic values from Fluid to TypoScript: Render a video with flashplayer, using an URL from an object
		property.</h3>

	<p>In this example we have a website with a video podcast. We want to show the video of each podcast episode using a
		flashplayer (like youtube does for example). The videos itself are stored as mp4 files somewhere in the cloud.
		So all we need to have is the URL of the video as a property of the episode object.
	</p>
	<h4>Fluid:</h4>
	<pre>&lt;f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath=&quot;lib.flashPlayer&quot; data=&quot;{episode.url}&quot; /&gt;</pre>
	<h4>TypoScript:</h4>
	<pre>lib.flashPlayer = SWFOBJECT<br/>lib.flashPlayer {<br/>&nbsp; file.current = 1<br/>&nbsp; width = 400<br/>&nbsp; height = 300<br/>&nbsp; type = video<br/>&nbsp; layout = ###SWFOBJECT###<br/>&nbsp; video.player = typo3/contrib/flashmedia/flvplayer.swf<br/>&nbsp; forcePlayer = 1<br/>}</pre>
	<h4>Result:</h4>

	<p><img alt="Video Player" style="padding: 8px;" src="/files/images/video.png" height="299" width="400"/>&nbsp;
	</p>

	<h3>4. Alternative notations for passing dynamic data: Again a Flash video of a podcast</h3>

	<p>We use the same example like above, but introduce some alternative notations. This should help to get an idea
		about how Fluid notation can look like.
	</p>
	<h4>Fluid:</h4>
	<pre>A. &lt;f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath=&quot;lib.flashPlayer&quot; data=&quot;{episode.url}&quot; /&gt;<br/><br/>B. {episode.url -&gt; f:cObject(typoscriptObjectPath: 'lib.flashPlayer')}<br/><br/>C. &lt;f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath=&quot;lib.flashPlayer&quot;&gt;{episode.url}&lt;/f:cObject&gt;<br/><br/>D. &lt;f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath=&quot;lib.flashPlayer&quot;&gt;&lt;f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath=&quot;lib.alternativeVideoUrl&quot; /&gt;&lt;/f:cObject&gt;</pre>
	<h4>TypoScript:</h4>
	<pre>lib.flashPlayer = SWFOBJECT<br/>lib.flashPlayer {<br/>&nbsp; file.current = 1<br/>&nbsp; width = 400<br/>&nbsp; height = 300<br/>&nbsp; type = video<br/>&nbsp; layout = ###SWFOBJECT###<br/>&nbsp; video.player = typo3/contrib/flashmedia/flvplayer.swf<br/>&nbsp; forcePlayer = 1<br/>}</pre>
	<pre>lib.alternativeVideoUrl = TEXT<br/>lib.alternativeVideoUrl.value = http://www.example.com/my_video.mp4</pre>
	<h4>Explanation of the Fluid notation: </h4>

	<p>A. The first Fluid notation is taken from the above example. It represents the shorthand XML notation.
	</p>

	<p>B. The second one looks a bit complicated on the first sight. But it should give you an impression that you can
		&quot;chain&quot; multiple ViewHelpers.
	</p>

	<p>C. The third example represents the XML notation with starttag and endtag and the value in between.
	</p>

	<p>D. The forth notation points to the fact, that you can pass nested ViewHelpers as data. (refered as the
		renderChildren feature). In our case, the data which is passed to the lib.flashPlayer TS object is taken from
		another TS object. Take into account, that any spaces and linebreaks also get passed and could cause unwanted
		effects.
	</p>

	<h3>5. Passing whole objects to TypoScript: Show the price of a product only when the product is available.</h3>

	<p>In the last example, we have a product object with a some properties like price, availability, description etc.
		The two properties which are of interest here are price and availability. We only want to show the price, if the
		product is available.
	</p>
	<h4>Fluid:</h4>
	<pre>&lt;f:cObject typoscriptObjectPath=&quot;lib.productPrice&quot; data=&quot;{product}&quot; /&gt;</pre>
	<h4>TypoScript:</h4>
	<pre>lib.productPrice = TEXT<br/>lib.productPrice {<br/>&nbsp; field = price<br/>&nbsp; fieldRequired = available<br/>&nbsp; wrap = Price: |<br/>}</pre>
	<h4>Result:</h4>
	<pre>Price: 99,- $</pre>
	<p>What we do here is to pass the full object to the cObject ViewHelper instead of only one property. This makes it
		possible to use all properties of the product object in the TypoScript cObject. In the above example we check if
		there's a value in the &quot;product.available&quot; property. Only if this condition is true, we show the
		product.price. Of course this task could also be solved by using the if/then/else ViewHelper.
	</p>

	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>The cObject Viewhelper combines the power of Fluid with TypoScript. Before you think about writing your own
		ViewHelper to solve a task, you should think about solving this task with TypoScript. Especially if you york
		with people which are new to Fluid, but TypoScript gurus. Not to forget that TypoScript Objects are far more
		configurable for admins than PHP code of Fluid ViewHelpers are. If you know some more tricks with TypoScript and
		Fluid, please share it with us and write a comment.

				Hey,<br/>
				<br/>
				nice article :-) Just a short question: I don't get what you mean with the example 4) -- I cannot really
				imagine why this should work.<br/>

				Hi Sebastian,<br/>
				<br/>
				thanks for your comments.<br/>
				<br/>
				I am not sure which of the notations your refer to in example 4.<br/>
				I changed the article a bit to make it more clear what my intentions are. Technically all examples
				should work, since I tested them before posting. Please note that I removed linebreaks in notation D to
				make clear that any character matters.

				Hi Steffen,<br/>
				<br/>
				regarding example 5. What if you want to access an object storage field inside of your product object.
				For example your product contains a sub-object productmanager and you want to access the name of this
				manager.<br/>
				<br/>
				field = product.manager.name doesn't seem to work.<br/>
				<br/>
				Best regards<br/>
				Markus

			<p>
				It should correctly read:<br/>
				field = manager.name<br/>
				<br/>
				But this will also not work. I guess there's a limitation in TypoScript getData, which is not able to
				handle nested objects/arrays in the way you tried to.<br/>
				<br/>
				Maybe there's a way to juggle this kind of data. If anyone knows, please post. I'd also be interested.

				Hi Steffen, <br/>
				<br/>
				Number 5 does not work for me, ist only works with some modifications: <br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				lib.productPrice = TEXT<br/>
				lib.productPrice {<br/>
				current = 1<br/>
				required = 1<br/>
				wrap = Price: |<br/>
				}<br/>
				<br/>
				In my tests this works with subobjects too. <br/>

				@Peter<br/>
				<br/>
				What TYPO3 version did you use for testing example 5? The article bases on TYPO3 4.4. Maybe something
				changed in 4.5? Could you please test this?

				If you need to pass properties from several objects, put them into an array. For example:<br/>
				<br/>
				You want to link the product title <em>{product.title}</em> to a certain page. This page is configured
				on a global scope in TypoScript settings <em>{settings.order.pid}</em>:<br/>
			<pre><code>## Fluid
&lt;f:cObject
  typoscriptObjectPath="lib.product"
  data="{title: product.title, orderPid: settings.order.pid}"
/&gt;

## TypoScript
lib.product = TEXT
lib.product {
  field = title
  wrap = Click to buy our new |
  typolink.parameter.field = orderPid
}</code></pre>

				As nice as it may seem, I ran into memory issues with the cObjectViewhelper on TYPO3 4.5. It did some
				simple arithmetics, and was called maybe 100x on a page. Transforming into a custom php based viewhelper
				resolved my issues.
