title: Thoughts about classifying objects in a digitalized world
date: 2008-10-04 12:36
excerpt: While reading for my thesis, I found some interesting articles about order and hierarchies in the web. One central issue in a digitalized world is the question of how to classify objects.

<section>
	<p>Before thinking about classification in a digital environment, it might be useful to take a look at the good
	old analog world. What's the difference between classification of objects in an analog and a digital world? When we
	face a large quantity of objects, we tend to order them to keep track of the sheer complexity. One way to deal with
	that, is to categorize things in a hierarchical order.
	</p>

	<p>For example, a friend of mine is collecting music records. He needs to order the records in his shelf to be able
		to quickly find a particular album. He chose the following hierarchical order:
	</p>
	<pre> 1. Genre<br/> 2. Musician/Band name<br/> 3. Album name </pre>
	<p>This kind of order is sufficient to find most of his albums. But from time to time, he has to face the situation
		to be wary about which genre to choose for a new album. Dub, Reggae or Ska? The circumstance to decide in terms
		of <i>either/or</i> pushes him into the uncomfortable situation of making more or less poor decisions.
	</p>

	<p>Now think about digitalizing all his records. The usual way to structure the digital copies is to save each song
		as a single file on the harddisk. These files are being stored inside directories, which represent the band name
		and/or the album name:
	</p>
	<pre>/Music/Bandname/Albumname/Songname.ogg</pre>
	<p>What pops up here is the habit to maintain structures of the analog world when transforming content into a
		digital form: A song belongs to a record and the record belongs to a band. This hierarchical paradigm seems to
		be widespread on desktop computers, although it is not mandatory. One can just as well use a database instead of
		a filesystem. In case of finding a certain song the represented file structure is not a limitation, because one
		can add any meta information to a song he likes. For example, a genre can be assigned to a song by using an id3
		tag. Based on this meta data, a music library software can crawl all directories and list all Reggae songs. We
		even could assign more than a single genre, just like this blog article is tagged with multiple tags. No more
		decision in terms of <i>either/or</i>, but in terms of <i>as-well-as</i>. That means more freedom in
		classification and less misdeterminations caused by enforced <i>yes-or-no</i> decisions. In contrast to the
		analog world, digital content can be separated from its mode of presentation. In combination with networking,
		this opens a new kind of freedom when it comes to classify content. In particular, collaborate classification as
		realized in so called folksonomies seems to be very helpful and popular.
	</p>

	<p>The other side of the coin is an increasing diffusion which may lead to disorientation. Human beings are heavily
		bound to the rules of the analog world and used to its limitations. Simple models of classification help to
		avoid uncertainty, even when they tend to cause wrong decisions. The challenge in a digitalized world is to make
		use of collaborate forces against the increasing confusion in a&nbsp;complex world. Folksonomies as a
		classification model seem to be a helpful step towards that. There might come a day when we have to skip using
		hierarchical ordered files and folders, because this kind of categorization gets too complex for handling the
		rapidly growing data.
