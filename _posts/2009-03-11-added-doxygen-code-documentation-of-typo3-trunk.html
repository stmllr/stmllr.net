title: Added doxygen code documentation of TYPO3 trunk
date: 2009-03-11 15:53
excerpt: I have added a page with code documentation of TYPO3, generated with doxygen. It provides a nice overview of the latest code from trunk and allows to search for classes, functions and properties in the bleeding edge TYPO3 core.
tags: 
  - TYPO3
  - TYPO3API
  - Doxygen
  - Trunk

	<p>After searching a while for an existing version of TYPO3 trunk without success, I decided to generate my own. You

		seperate page of this website.
	</p>

	<p>The search form allows you to find any function in the TYPO3 core within a few seconds and get all facts of its
		use, parameters and dependencies to other classes/functions. It gets updates on a regular basis via cron. If you
		like it, you can use it:
