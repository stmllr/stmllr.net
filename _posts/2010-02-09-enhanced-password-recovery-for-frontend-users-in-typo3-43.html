title: Enhanced password recovery for Frontend users in TYPO3 4.3
date: 2010-02-09 16:45
excerpt: Password recovery for frontend users before TYPO3 4.3 was poor and insecure. Passwords were sent by e-mail in plain text, the recovery form could be abused and revealed private information to public. While implementing the felogin sysext for a community website, I surprisingly found some fundamental changes in the recovery method in TYPO3 4.3.

	<p>In <a href="http://wiki.typo3.org/index.php/TYPO3_4.3.0" title="Feature list in the changelog of TYPO3 4.3"
				  class="external-link">TYPO3 4.3</a>, the password recovery method was <a
		href="http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=10017" title="Bug report of the issue"
		class="external-link">refactored</a> by <a href="http://www.sk-typo3.de/"
												   title="Personal website of Steffen Kamper" class="external-link">Steffen
	Kamper</a> and now looks much better than before. Let me demonstrate it step by step.
	</p>

	<h3>How does FE-user password recovery work?</h3>
	<h4>1) Send your e-mail or username to recover the account password:</h4>

	</p>

	<p><img src="/files/images/typo3_recover_password_2.jpg" height="170" width="508" alt=""/>
	</p>
	<h4>2) If the e-mail or username exists, you'll get a mail with a tokenized link to create a new password.</h4>

	<p>Check your e-mail account and open the link within the limited timeframe. The link has a token, which combines
		the timestamp and a hash to identify the request:
	</p>

	</p>
	<h4>3) Enter the new password twice. There is a simple check for password lenght:</h4>

	</p>
	<h4>4) Finished. The new password has been saved to the database and you can proceed to login:</h4>

	</p>

	<h3>Problems I met</h3>

	<p>When trying the new recovery stuff, it first did not work. But after some debugging I found out, that some POST
		parameters were missing, because I used an outdated custom template file. If you use a custom template, make
		sure to update it accordingly.
	</p>

	<h3>Some further aspects</h3>

	<p>To configure the FE output and email text, have a look at the TypoScript of the extension with template analyzer.
		You could also override the content of the locallang files with TypoScript:
	</p>
	<pre>plugin.tx_felogin_pi1._LOCAL_LANG.[lang].label = text</pre>
	<p>Of course the password check could be enhanced by adding more complex checks. But anyway, felogin in 4.3 looks
		very good. The <a
				href="https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Core/branches/TYPO3_4-3/typo3/sysext/saltedpasswords/doc/manual.sxw"
				title="saltedpasswords manual in the SVN repository" class="external-link">documentation</a> claims that
		recovery also works with saltedpasswords sysext. That's great, because the FE-user stuff now looks much more
		secure than before.&nbsp;Salted password for TYPO3 are explained in a&nbsp;<a
				href="http://secure.t3sec.info/blog/permalink/34/" title="TYPO3 4.3 system extension saltedpasswords"
				class="external-link">blog article by Marcus Krause</a>. Unfortunately, the <a
				href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sr_feuser_register/current/"
				title="Front End User Registration in TER" class="external-link">sr_feuser_register extension</a> does
		not (yet) natively support saltedpasswords. But you can try the <a
				href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/srfeuserregister_t3secsaltedpw/current/"
				title="Bridging saltedpasswords and sr_feuser_registration" class="external-link">extension
			srfeuserregister_t3secsaltedpw</a> from TER, which should work as a bridge.
	</p>

	<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>If you use custom template files, have a look for changes in the original files of new releases. In case of
			felogin, there have been major changes from 4.2 to 4.3. It was neccessary to update my custom template
			manually.
		</li>
		<li>No matter how hard you try to follow the core changelog, there's always the chance to find a feature by
			surprise.
		</li>
	</ul>
