title: Security issue in TYPO3 Extension Secure Directory (kw_secdir)
date: 2008-09-19 19:24
excerpt: Today, the TYPO3 security team released a collective security bulletin. Since I am the author of one extension which was listed in the bulletin (kw_secdir), I'd like to comment this a little bit. Especially the severity of "high" sounds evil, but it's IMHO less dangerous than some might think.

<section>
	<p>The extension was mentioned in the <a
		href="http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-20080919-1/"
		title="Security Bulletin on typo3.org" class="external-link">Collective Security Bulletin TYPO3-20080919-1</a>,
	which was released today, September 19, 2008.
	</p>

	<h3>Details about the issue:</h3>

	<p>I got a mail on June 30, 2008 from the security team about the extension. It allows BE users to enter username,
		password and hosts in the filelist module. The problem here was, that the host parameter was &quot;not properly
		sanitized, making it possible to add arbitrary code lines to a htaccess file&quot;, the security team wrote. An
		example how to insert malicious values was appended:
	</p>

	<p><em>POC: all%0DAddType application/x-httpd-php .txt</em>
	</p>

	<p>This could lead to arbitrary code execution, because user were then able to upload executable PHP code in the
		filelist module (under certain conditions, see below).
	</p>

	<h3>Description of the patch:</h3>

	<p>I added a routine to compare the input field against a whitelist of characters to prevent injection of control
		characters.
	</p>

	<p>A fixed version was released on July 8, 2008. So far the technical facts.
	</p>

	<h3>Criticism:</h3>

	<p>What I do not understand, is the bulletin severity of HIGH:
	</p>

	<p>The vulnerability only affects systems with unsafe Apache configuration, namely the infamous <em>AllowOverride
		All</em> for .htaccess context. It is even mentioned in the extension manual not to use that, because it opens
		doors for security holes. So no excuse if someone didn't give a f*** about this and was hit by the issue.
	</p>

	<p>Also, why did the security team wait more than two month to release a bulletin earlier, if the severity is so
		high?
	</p>

	<p>Please don't get me wrong. The issue was there and some user may have been affected. But there was no description
		at all in the bulletin, and I wanted to cast a light on this.
	</p>
