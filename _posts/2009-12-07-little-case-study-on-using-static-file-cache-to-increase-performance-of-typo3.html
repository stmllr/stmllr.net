title: Little case study on using static file cache to increase performance of TYPO3
date: 2009-12-07 17:51
excerpt: The average number of requests on www.t3node.com is growing more and more. Since the website is hosted on a tiny virtual machine shared with others, the overall server performance is bad. Today I decided to serve pages from file cache to reduce the load. This little case study describes the problem by example and gives some key data for illustration.

	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	<p>There are several other websites hosted on the server and TYPO3 is not the only one eating performance. At peak
		periods, the server load&nbsp;is very high and pages are served with much delay. Not only visitors suffer from
		slow websites, but there are rumors that&nbsp;google may take performance into ranking account (so called speed
		rank).
	</p>

	<h3>Solution</h3>

	<p>Since this website is driven by TYPO3, I decided to install the <a
			href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/nc_staticfilecache/current/"
			title="static file cache extension in TER on typo3.org" class="external-link">static file cache extension
		(nc_static_file_cache)</a>.This extension puts pages from the page cache to files in the filesystem. Whenever a
		page is requested, it gets served from the file system without involving TYPO3.
	</p>

	<h3>Test results (1)</h3>

	<p>To test the performance gain, I used ApacheBench (ab) on the start page:
	</p>
	<pre>spock@enterprise:/tmp$ ab -c 10 -n 1000 http ://www.t3node.com/</pre>
	<p>The result was disappointing <b>8 req/s.</b>
	</p>

	<p>After some investigation I realized that most of my pages did not profit from this cache. The info module of the
		static file cache extension reported, that they could not be statically served because they contain&nbsp;uncached
		USER_INT objects. Inspections with the admpanel revealed two extensions which use USER_INT:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/nc_ttnews_mostpopular/current/"
			   title="News: most popular extension in TER on typo3.org" class="external-link">'News:&nbsp;most popular'
			extension (nc_ttnews_mostpopular)</a>, which was used to count and display hits of the blog articles.
		</li>
		<li><a href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/tp_twitter/current/"
			   title="Twitter RSS feed extension in TER on typo3.org" class="external-link">Twitter RSS feed extension
			(tp_twitter)</a>, which was used to show my latest three tweets.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Fixing the issues</h3>

	<p>I decided to remove the 'most popular' extension, since I never really liked the approach to save statistic data
		in the database table of the entity. I am going to look for something similar, maybe using some JavaScript
		counter or Apache access_log in combination with <a
				href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/coago/current/"
				title="COA_GO extension in TER on typo3.org" class="external-link">COA_GO</a>.
	</p>

	<p>The Tweet is still shown, but as a cached USER object which will be updated once a day. I think that's a good
		compromise, since my twitter activity is anyway not so high.
	</p>

	<h3>Test results (2)</h3>

	<p>To test the performance gain, I used ApacheBench (ab) on the start page:
	</p>
	<pre>spock@enterprise:/tmp$ ab -c 10 -n 1000 http ://www.t3node.com/</pre>
	<p>With USER_INT cObjects: <b>8 req/s.</b>
	</p>

	<p>Without USER_INT cObjects and without static file cache: <b>40 req/s.</b>
	</p>

	<p>Without USER_INT cObjects and with static file cache: <b>500 req/s.</b>
	</p>

	<p>That's <b>62.5 times faster</b> than before! Ready to get slashdottet :-)
	</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>

	<p>Performance can be crucial. If your website feels slow, search for bottlenecks like USER_INT extensions. If you
		can manage to get rid of USER_INT cObjects, chances are that you can also profit by a static file cache. That
		could push your website performance to lightning speed.

				Ahm you may or may not already optimizie and proper configure the hole apache subset<br/>
				<br/>
				not only php optimizer and proper mem config (never use to much btw) <br/>
				<br/>
				also think about to switch to ngix <br/>
				<br/>
				another server threatment you shoudl consider are ssds<br/>
				<br/>
				they are not suitable for big datastorage but for the typo3 core it is (symlinking to different
				partitions)<br/>
				<br/>
				the big advantage is you get high speed drives for about 150â‚¬ - even used as a mirror softwareraid they
				are faster than a high end raid 10 combination <br/>
				<br/>
				simply one drive can read at 450mb/sec and seek times below 1ms while even a multiarray MAYBE be ablle
				to deliver that datarate it can never deliver that seek time <br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				typo3 - is a bitch - because of its contruction - accessing so many files for every simple function -
				here you profit from php optimizer with cache in memory / ramdisks and ssds<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				- <br/>
				if you have to much server memory but no ssds - simple solution - mount in fsck a ramdrive - make a
				startupscript copying the directory of typo3 core into it<br/>
				<br/>
				links your installations to that new drive<br/>
				<br/>
				voilla - high speed typo3 core :)<br/>
				<br/>
				i personally prefer ssds for some reasons - specially after reboot take a while to copy the content
