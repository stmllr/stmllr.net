	<p>This posting is not meant as a tutorial shipping complete sources, but a snippet to give you an impression of the
		essentials. So don't be disappointed if you won't find some ready-to-paste snippets.
	</p>

	<p>The idea is to create a link to a file, which is set in the media field of the page. You can find this field in
		the page properties below the ressources tab and its label in the backend is &quot;Files&quot;.
	</p>

	<p>Once you have chosen the file in the backend, it gets copied to the uploads/media/ directory. In the plugin, we
		need to get the filename and then simply build a link around it. &quot;That's easy&quot;, you might think,
		&quot;just get the filename from TSFE and put some a href tag around it and it's finished&quot;. But as this
		snippet will show, you don't need to think about HTML at all. The magic lies inside the <a
				href="http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/references/doc_core_tsref/4.1.0/view/5/13/"
				title="filelink function reference in TSref" class="external-link">filelink function</a> of TypoScript.
	</p>
	<pre>// path to the file<br/>$filePath = 'uploads/media/'.$GLOBALS['TSFE']-&gt;page['media'];<br/>// use the filelink function to create a rich feature link<br/>$content = $this-&gt;cObj-&gt;filelink(<br/>  $filePath,<br/>  $this-&gt;conf['fileLink.']<br/>); </pre>
	<p>This is only a few lines of PHP code! Next we need to configure the filelink with in the TypoScript setup of the
		plugin:
	</p>
	<pre>plugin.tx_myplugin_pi1 {<br/>&nbsp; fileLink {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file.noTrimWrap = | | |<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; labelStdWrap.data = page:media<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icon = 1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icon_link = 1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size = 1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size.wrap = (|)<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size.bytes = 1<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size.bytes.labels = &quot; B| KB| MB| GB&quot;<br/>&nbsp; }<br/>}</pre>
	<p>The result is a full featured link with an icon corresponding to the content type and the size of the file:
	</p>

	<p><img src="/files/examples/demo.png" alt=""/>
