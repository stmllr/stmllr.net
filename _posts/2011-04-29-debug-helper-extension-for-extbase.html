title: Debug Helper Extension for Extbase
date: 2011-04-29 01:27
excerpt: Extbase in TYPO3 4.5 LTS has no built-in possibility to debug model objects. Whenever you try to var_dump() a model object or log it to t3lib_div::devLog(), you'll probably end up in out-of-memory exceptions. This article introduces an extension as a temporary solution for that.

	<h3>What's wrong with var_dump()?</h3>

	<p>Because of circular dependencies in Extbase, dumps made with <a
			href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php" title="var_dump() function reference on php.net"
			class="external-link">var_dump()</a> will contain hugh amounts of useless object data of various framework
		classes. Your memory will probaly be exhausted and an exception is thrown. And you probably do not expect that
		with 1 GB of RAM reserved for PHP, do you?
	</p>

	<p>A solution was backported from FLOW3 by Felix Oertel but it is still <a href="http://forge.typo3.org/issues/7784"
																			   title="Related issue in the Extbase bugtracker"
																			   class="external-link">pending in the
		bugtracker</a>. So we probably won't see it in TYPO3 core until 4.6. To fill the gap between now and then, I
		merged the code into an extension and provide it for download.
	</p>

	<h3>Extension Download</h3>

	<p>The extension&nbsp;<a href="/files/ext/T3X_ext_debug.t3x" title="Download the TYPO3 extension ext_debug"
							 class="download">ext_debug</a>&nbsp;can be downloaded.&nbsp;It is in early alpha state and
		not yet finished. This is why it is not yet available in forge or TER. Be patient.
	</p>

	<h3>Extension&nbsp;Usage</h3>

	<p>e.g. in BlogController.php
	</p>
	<pre>[...]<br/> public function indexAction() {<br/>    $blogs = $this-&gt;blogRepository-&gt;findAll();<br/>    foreach ($blogs as $blog) {<br/>      Tx_ExtDebug::var_dump($blog);<br/>    }<br/> }<br/> [...] </pre>
	<h3>Result</h3>

	<h3>Oops, an error occured!</h3>

	<p>Yes, I am aware of that. The debugger still needs some work. If you want to contribute, please do so and use the

				What exactly does mot work? Do you get any PHP errors in your logs?<br/>
				ATM I have no PHP 5.2 system at hand.

				Okay, this (http://php.net/manual/de/reflectionproperty.setaccessible.php) only works for PHP >= 5.3 :-(<br/>
				<br/>
				Hopefully someone finds a workaround?

				I am sorry, I have no time to support legacy for PHP 5.2. Anyway, TYPO3 4.6 will be released in a few
				days and it depends on PHP 5.3.

				Thanks for the extension. I run it on Typo 6.0.2 for extension development with fluid und extbase, but
				I'm not really a programmer. Using it in the ext_localconf it works properly. I go in the Backend to
				"Installation" and the debug window pops out.<br/>
				But I want to use it in the action-classes, to test the variables there. But I don't get any output from
				there. Do you have a hint what IÂ´m doing wrong.<br/>
				Thanks ahead!<br/>
				Christian

				Hi Christian, from TYPO3 4.7 and higher you don't need this extension.<br/>
				<br/>
				Just use:<br/>
				<br/>
				TYPO3\CMS\Extbase\Utility\DebuggerUtility::var_dump($variable);<br/>

			</p>

				Hi Steffen, thanks for your answer. I tried this function too, but I don't get an output of my variables
				in the action classes. It works only in the ext_localconf.php. Any idea, what I`m doing wrong?

				Hi Christian. I'd suggest to ask in the TYPO3 forum at http://forum.typo3.org/index.php/f/60/
