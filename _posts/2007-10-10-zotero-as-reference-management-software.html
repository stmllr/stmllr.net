title: Zotero as reference management software
date: 2007-10-10 12:59
excerpt: Searching and collecting research sources without an appropriate method and tool might lead into time-consuming confusion. Looking for a way to avoid a growing unstructured collection of 3x5 cards/files, I stumbled over the reference management software Zotero. And it rocks!

	<p>
		My thesis is coming nearer and the list of potential useful books is growing. So I decided to start using a
		reference management software to organize my bibliographic collection. 
		A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software" title="Comparison of reference management software at wikipedia" class="external-link" >comparison at Wikipedia</a>
		gave me a first overview, then I decided to try <a href="http://www.zotero.org/" title="Homepage of the Zotero project" class="external-link" >Zotero</a>.
		My decision was based on four factors:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Zotero comes as a Firefox extension. I like the idea, because the browser is my favorite tool for almost any research.</li>
			<li>It also ships an Openoffice package, to integrate the references into my favorite word processor.</li>
			<li>It's open source software.</li>
			<li>There's an active community.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		Zotero does not only collect research sources on a meta level (author, title, year, ...) but also archives and
		indexes full text items (e.g. HTML, PDF). Tags and relations make it easy to structure and categorize items.
	</p>
	<p>
		The installation is really easy and the documentation helps you to understand things within a short time.
		Give it a try.</p>
