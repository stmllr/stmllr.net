		threaded view between <i>all</i> and <i>unread only</i>. It provides some kind of a shortcut buttons, which help

	<p><img alt="Thunderbird screenshot showing all threads" src="/files/images/show_all.png" width="443" height="197"/>
	</p>

	<p>You can hide all threads which do not have any unread postings:
	</p>

	<p><img alt="Thunderbird screenshot showing only threads with unread postings"
			src="/files/images/show_unread_only.png" width="437" height="153"/>
	</p>
