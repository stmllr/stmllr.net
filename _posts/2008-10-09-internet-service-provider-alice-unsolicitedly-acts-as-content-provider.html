excerpt: Since a few days, the Internet service provider Alice (Hansenet / Telecom Italia) abuses my DSL connection by showing unsolicited advertisements. I cannot accept this behavior.

	<p>Browser requests to non-existent DNS names are redirected to an advertising website with google ads. What
	they call &quot;service&quot;, in my opinion is abuse. I never asked for this kind of service. I pay them as an
	internet service provider and not as a content provider. If they earn money by forcing me to watch google ads, I
	insist to get paid for that. Also I don't want to be bugged by non functional opt-out links which do not stop this
	crap. Last but not least, it is a privacy interference, because phrases of my requests are used as subject for the
	google ads and probably forwarded to some third party.
	</p>

	<p>Not only are they breaking internet standards and abuse privacy, but they act as a content provider. And this may
		have adverse consequences for them:<br/>In Germany, all content providers (&quot;Anbieter von Mediendiensten&quot;)
		are forced by law (&quot;Telemediengesetzes&quot;) to maintain an impress on their website. If they do not, they
		risk to get some kind of cease-and-desist order (&quot;Abmahnung und Unterlassungsaufforderung&quot;), which not
		only costs money but could turn press spotlights on this abuse. This hopefully attracts lawyers as well as the
		press and stops this nonsense.
	</p>

	<p>Btw, Verisign once started a similar &quot;service&quot; which earned lots of critique. They could have learned
		from that.
	</p>

	<p>Now finally, let's welcome Alice on my personal blacklist of companies-to-be-never-recommended.
