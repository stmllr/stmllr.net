	<p>The <a href="http://lists.netfielders.de/cgi-bin/queuegraph.cgi" title="statistics of the postfix queue"
				   class="external-link">charts</a> give us an impression about how many mails were defered in the
	postfix queue. You can compare this value with the total amount of incoming/active/delivered mails. This information
	does neither reveal the reason for queuing or the duration mails spent in the queue. But it gives us a first
	impression about the server (postfix) load.
