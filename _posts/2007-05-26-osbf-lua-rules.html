excerpt: Last week, I moved my IMAP account from university to a privately hosted server. At the same time, I said goodbye to Spamassassin and switched to OSBF-lua - the results were impressive...

		Already installed by <a href="http://underused.org/" title="Michael Scharkow" class="external-link" >Michael</a>, I just had to create some maildrop rules to feed <a href="http://osbf-lua.luaforge.net/" title="OSBF-lua project website at sourceforge" class="external-link" >OSBF-lua</a>. After training the bayes database with 42 pieces of spam and 9 of ham, almost any following spam was classified correctly as bulk. The training was easy. Besides some perl/shell scripts, the bayes filter can be trained by sending false pos/negs back to OSBF-lua. You simply have to change the 'Subject:' and 'To:' headers (remember majordomo?). The first thing that came to my mind was: Hey, this could easily be done with a one-click button in Thunderbird. Any extension out there?<br />  <br />
