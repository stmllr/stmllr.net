title: How to find hidden TYPO3 features?
date: 2008-08-04 11:02
excerpt: From time to time, TYPO3 core devs and insiders leak secret knowledge in the mailinglists. One can find questions about "how to do this?" with answers surprisingly revealing undocumented features. Read on for some hints about how to find those features without asking.

	<h3>TYPO3 wiki: <a href="http://wiki.typo3.org/index.php/Pending_Documentation"
							title="TYPO3 wiki page about features which needs to be added to the official docs"
							class="external-link">pending documentation section</a>
	</h3>

	<p>The first place to look for those features is the <a href="http://wiki.typo3.org/index.php/Pending_Documentation"
															title="TYPO3 wiki page about features which needs to be added to the official docs"
															class="external-link">pending documentation section</a> in
		the TYPO3 wiki. It's meant to be the place for documentation of all new features, which have been added to the
		trunk, but not yet released. The items are collected here, reviewed and then put into the docs at typo3.org.
		Sometimes, this process is a little bit delayed and the wiki page becomes the only referrer to new features of
		an actual release. In this context, we can see <a
				href="http://support.typo3.org/teams/core/m/re-typo3-core-rfc-9046-nested-domain-linking-with-domain-record-on-root-page-356324/"
				title="Comment in RFC: #9046: Nested domain linking with domain record on root page"
				class="external-link">Dmitry bashing Michael in the core list</a> about that: &quot;(...) Stucki is
		responsible for [not] updating core documentation in time. kick him, I am already tired of doing it. (...)&quot;
		(Dmitry, 2008/07/31).
	</p>

	<h3>Forge: <a href="http://forge.typo3.org/repositories/browse/typo3v4-core/Documentation/trunk"
				  title="Latest core docs waiting for release" class="external-link">Core docs in the subversion
		trunk</a></h3>

	<p>Francois kindly <a
			href="http://support.typo3.org/teams/core/m/typo3-core-fyi-updated-tsref-with-pending-documentation-360561/"
			title="Discussion thread in the core list" class="external-link">updated TSref</a> with all pending parts
		from the wiki. To be release soon...
	</p>

	<h3>Bugtracker: <a
			href="http://bugs.typo3.org/search.php?project_id=21&amp;sticky_issues=on&amp;sortby=last_updated&amp;dir=DESC&amp;hide_status_id=90"
			title="List of bugs about TYPO3 documentation" class="external-link">documentation category</a></h3>

	<p>Another place is the bugtracker. There is a <a
			href="http://bugs.typo3.org/search.php?project_id=21&amp;sticky_issues=on&amp;sortby=last_updated&amp;dir=DESC&amp;hide_status_id=90"
			title="List of bugs about TYPO3 documentation" class="external-link">documentation section in mantis</a>,
		where tough users could have reported items about missing documentation.
	</p>

	<h3>Mailinglists: <a href="http://support.typo3.org/other-views/search-newsgroups/"
						 title="TYPO3 mailinglist archive at typo3.org" class="external-link">recently committed
		features</a></h3>

	<p>Last but not least, you could RTFML, especially the core list. Use the <a
			href="http://support.typo3.org/other-views/search-newsgroups/"
			title="TYPO3 mailinglist archive at http://support.typo3.org" class="external-link">search function of
		support.typo3.org</a> for a full bodytext search. Although &quot;we cannot expect from our users to read the
		Core list to learn about new features&quot; (<a
				href="http://support.typo3.org/teams/core/m/re-typo3-core-rfc-9109-enable-feature-in-element-browser-in-rte-like-in-normal-one-356680/p/99/"
				title="Masi commenting RFC: #9046" class="external-link">Masi, 2008/08/04</a>), it however seems to be
		the price one has to pay for living on the bleeding edge.

				System extensions usually ship their own documentation as OpenOffice document. These docs are located in
				the Extension directory in docs/manual.sxw<br/>
				At the moment (2010/01) they are not rendered on typo3.org although they are part of the core. You can
				get access to these docs via the extension manager.
