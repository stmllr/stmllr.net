title: Added some Description in german
date: 2009-02-15 21:56
excerpt: People sometimes ask me about a german version of this website. Although I am a native german speaker I do not plan to translate this blog to german. Nevertheless, I added a page with descriptions about me and this site in german.

	<p>The new <a href="/steffen-mueller.html" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">page
	with german comments</a> should not only give non-english users an impression about my work, but also improve the
	website ranking in the german google index.
