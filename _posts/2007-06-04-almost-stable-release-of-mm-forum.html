	<p>The extension in particular drives the popular german TYPO3 forum at <a href="http://www.typo3.net"
																					title="TYPO3 community webforum"
																					class="external-link">www.typo3.net</a>
	and thus seems to be fit for higher load environments. Unfortunately, I don't have any statistics (like traffic
	peaks) so this assumption is pure theory. According to Mittwald, 19.000 users have registered at typo3.net and
	230.000 postings have been written yet. But without any knowledge about the data distribution, this is just a bunch
	of numbers (probably growing since 2001).<br/>
	</p>

	<p>The forum is shipped with a build-in crawler and search engine, optimized for searching forum postings - a wise
		decision, since indexed_search is almost infamous for causing heavy load and timeouts in large scale
		environments.
	</p>

	<p>A first look at the database tables reveals the use of indexes for some columns/tables. Indexes can speed up
		SELECT statements but are yet rarely implemented in any extension. Anyway, thanks to the efforts of core-dev <a
				href="http://typo3bloke.net/" title="Website of Dmitry Dulepov" class="external-link">Dmitry Dulepov</a>,
		they are meanwhile common in core and sysext tables.
	</p>

	<p>The extension is available via extension repository or directly via <a
			href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/mm_forum/0.1.0/"
			title="mm_forum in the extension repository at typo3.org" class="external-link">typo3.org</a>.</p>
