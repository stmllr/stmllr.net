	<p>Inspired by the <a href="http://typo3bloke.net/post-details/t3dd08_productivity_session/"
							   title="Topic map of Dmitrys speech" class="external-link">productivity session of Dmitry
	Dulepov</a> at the <a href="http://t3dd08.typo3.org" title="T3DD08: TYPO3 Developer Days 2008 at Elmhorn/Germany"
						  class="external-link">TYPO3 Developer Days 2008</a>, I decided to improve my personal
	workflow. In his speech, Dmitry referred to a book of <a href="http://www.davidco.com/"
															 title="Website of David Allen" class="external-link">David
		Allen</a> called <em>Getting Things Done</em>. In spite of my usual aversion for <em>pseudo psycho manage your
		life properly</em> guides, I ordered the book. <br/>Trying to apply my reading to real life, I soon realized one
	problem in my paperless home office: the software tools I was using were quite limited to apply Allen's
	propositions. <br/>Today I stumbled upon a <a
			href="http://t3n.yeebase.com/aktuell/news/newspost/chandler-project-open-source-pim-als-outlook-alternative/1719/"
			title="Review of Chandler (german language)" class="external-link">news article at T3N</a> about <a
			href="http://chandlerproject.org" title="The Chandler project website" class="external-link">Chandler</a>.
	This note-to-self organizer seems to integrate the <em>Getting Things Done</em> concept. I have just finished the
	installation and my first impression is satisfactory:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/ScreenShots" title="Collection of screenshots of Chandler"
				   class="external-link-new-window">user interface</a> looks intuitive and familiar with its three
			columns layout.
		</li>
		<li>The clear use of colors gives you a quick overview about important actions.</li>
		<li>Most important: I was able to recover the &quot;do it, defer it, delegate it&quot; pradigm at once.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The next days I'll try to find out how good it really fits my needs...</p>
