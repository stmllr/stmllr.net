My name is Steffen Müller and I'm lead software engineer at [BackHub](https://backhub.co/ "Back up and Archive your GitHub Repositories") and [/gebrüderheitz](http://gebruederheitz.de/ "Building pioneering web- and mobile apps.") in Freiburg, Germany.
I'm contributing to several open source projects, preferedly TYPO3 CMS. From 2013 to 2017 I was a member of the TYPO3 core team.

Others call me: [skeptical perfectionist](https://typo3.org/news/article/typo3-cms-60-end-of-life-announcement/ "TYPO3 CMS 6.0 contributor credits"), [Behavior-Driven Development](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/ "BDD Introduction by Dan North") addict and even IT security paranoid.
I appreciate the spirit of free/open source software communities.
All that gets reflected on twitter via [@stmllr](https://twitter.com/stmllr "Steffen Müller on twitter") and on [GitHub](https://github.com/stmllr/ "Steffen Müller on github")

## At work...

My daily work covers:

**Simplicity**: Simpler means easier to understand, easier to maintain and less error-prone. Simplicity does not mean quick+dirty.

**Requirement analysis**: focusing on customer needs to build the right things - applying agile methods, like user stories, example mapping and rapid prototyping.

**Consulting**: Analysis and evaluation of software architecture and quality, for example structural code analysis, basic security audits and performance tests.

**Planning**: Creating technical concepts and deciding on tools, processes and approaches, for example Domain Driven Design.

**Software Architecture & Development**: Creating sustainable yet pragmatic solutions, based on object oriented software. Continuous refactoring and using design patterns are basic parts of that.

**Quality assurance**: Doing the things right - and doing the right things: Applied Test/Behavior Driven Development with Cucumber, Rspec, PHPUnit and Behat/Mink + Selenium, from unit tests over functional tests to full blown acceptance tests.

**Continuous Integration**: Fully automated Software Tests + Builds + Deployments using continuous integration services, deploy pipes and containerization with docker.

**Infrastructure as code**: Managing cloud services (AWS) with terraform.

**Team lead and coaching**: Enabling teams to successfully create and deliver software into the enterprise.

**Working mode**: Mainly Scrum, remote and on-site, focusing and delivering the important things.

## Open Source: TYPO3 community

The TYPO3 community teached me how to master software projects in the 21st century: Working remotely, asynchronously, in heterogenous constantly changing teams with changing requirement. Fixing real world issues.

My first contact with the TYPO3 community was in 2002. Many years later, in 2013, I became an official [core team member](http://typo3.org/teams/core-development-team/roles-groups/ "Roles and group in the TYPO3 CMS project") with merge rights. In 2017 I stepped back from this role. I have been a member of the [TYPO3 security team](http://typo3.org/teams/security/ "TYPO3 security team") from 2004 to 2008 and 2013-2017. Last but not least, I am a reviewer of the TYPO3 developer certification program and maintain and develop several [community extensions](http://forge.typo3.org/users/348).

The [Open Source CMS TYPO3](http://typo3.org/ "The content management system TYPO3") is my favorite tool for content management. It combines enterprise level features with a well networked, highly active and progressive open source community.
